## Logistic Regression vs. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

### Overview
This project aims to apply and compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in predicting whether a patient has diabetes. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

### Project Structure
- **diabetes.csv**: The dataset containing information on various health parameters and diabetes outcomes.
- **SVN_LR.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that includes the implementation of Logistic Regression and SVMs, along with the necessary code to evaluate and compare their performances.
- **Logistic Regression vs. SVMs_Solution.pdf**: A detailed solution and explanation document comparing Logistic Regression and SVMs.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
To run the notebooks and scripts in this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

#### Running the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression-vs-svms.git
   cd logistic-regression-vs-svms
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SVN_LR.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook** to execute the code, visualize the data, and compare the models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before applying any machine learning algorithms, it's essential to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This involves:
- Visualizing the first few rows of the dataset.
- Getting a statistical summary of the data.
- Plotting relationships between different features and the target variable.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a fundamental method for binary classification. In this project, we use it to predict the presence of diabetes based on health parameters.

### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
SVMs are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They work well for both linear and non-linear data by using different kernel functions.

### Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding the performance of each model.

### Results
After training and evaluating both models, the accuracy scores are compared to determine which model performs better on the given dataset.
